To develop this website we have used some basic technologies like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODEJS, EXPRESS, MONGODB as database.

HTML : HTML is the language for describing the structure of Web pages. HTML gives authors the means to: Publish online documents with headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc.

CSS :  CSS is used to add style to a web page by dictating how a site is displayed on a browser. CSS is unique in that it doesn't create any new elements, like HTML or JavaScript. Instead, it's a language used to style HTML.

JAVASCRIPT: JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.
            You can go through this website to know more about it https://www.javascript.com/

NODEJS: Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but         was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

EXPRESS: ExpressJS is a prebuilt NodeJS framework that can help you in creating server-side web applications faster and smarter. Simplicity, minimalism, flexibility, scalability          are some of its characteristics and since it is made in NodeJS itself, it inherited its performance as well.

MONGODB: What is MongoDB known for?
         MongoDB is a document-oriented database which stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schema. It means you can store your records without worrying about the             data structure such as the number of fields or types of fields to store values.
